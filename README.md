config files from stock 1.1.4 firmware, with the addition of pause/resume macros commented out in macros.cfg. 

this allows for default mainsail pause resume behavior.

client.cfg is the updated version of mainsail.cfg, which is why mainsail.cfg is commented out. you should copy all files here to fix any pause/resume issues. 

ive also added a couple branches with MikeBCBC's changes to the filament runout sensor macros to revert back to default klipper behavior.
